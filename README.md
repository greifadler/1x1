## About The Project

The "1 ⋅ 1" app is a playful and colorful educational tool designed to help children learn and practice basic arithmetic operations: multiplication (`MAL`) and division (`DIVIDIEREN`) & (`IN`). With a focus on interactivity and engagement, the app introduces young learners to the world of numbers through fun exercises and challenges.

### Features

- **Interactive Exercises**: Children can practice multiplication, division, and addition with numbers in a fun and engaging way.
- **Progress Tracking**: The app tracks the learner's progress across different arithmetic operations, providing valuable feedback on their strengths and areas for improvement.
- **Colorful and Child-Friendly Interface**: Designed with young users in mind, the app features a vibrant and intuitive interface that makes learning enjoyable.
- **Dynamic Difficulty Levels**: Exercises adapt to the child's learning pace, gradually increasing in complexity as their skills develop.
